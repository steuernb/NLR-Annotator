# NLR-Annotator version 2

---

---

- Code rewritten
- Integrated motif search tool. No dependency of MEME.

## Introduction

NLR-Annotator is a tool to annotate loci associated with NLRs in large sequences.
It is searching for amino acid motifs within all 6 frames of a nucleotide sequence.
An NLR locus is defined from first to last motif that can be associated with an NLR.

It does NOT predict genes. A predicted NLR locus might be a pseudogene.
If it is overlapping with a gene, the actual gene start or intron-exon boundaries are not given.
It just points you to the loci that might be worth investigating, which we hope you will find useful.
Details are published in [Steuernagel et al.: The NLR-Annotator tool enables annotation of the intracellular immune receptor repertoire, Plant Physiology, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184345)

### JRE 1.6

Make sure you have the Java Runtime Environments 1.8 or higher. Download from http://java.com

## Installation

JRE is installed. Download jar file from [here](https://github.com/steuernb/NLR-Annotator/blob/NLR-Annotator-2/NLR-Annotator-v2.1b.jar)

You will need two config files, [mot.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steuernb/NLR-Annotator/NLR-Annotator-2/src/mot.txt) and [store.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steuernb/NLR-Annotator/NLR-Annotator-2/src/store.txt).

## Running NLR-Annotator

Run NLR-Annotator with `java -jar NLR-Annotator-v2.0.jar -i input.fasta -x mot.txt -y store.txt -o output.txt`

Replace "input.fasta" with the file (in fasta format) that contains the nucleotide sequences you want to annotate.
If mot.txt and store.txt are not in your current directory, add the path.

If you use the `-t` parameter to run NLR-Annotator with multiple threads, please make sure the machine you are running it on has enough cores available.

In case you get an out-of-memory exception, add more to the java virtual machine, e.g. `java -Xmx8000M -jar NLR-Annotator.jar ...` will allow for 8000 MB.
